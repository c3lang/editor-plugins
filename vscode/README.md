# VSCode C3 Extension (Syntax Highlighting and LSP)

This is the VSCode extension from the 'Editor Plugins' repo of C3 Programming Language. 

There is another extension under active development which includes the LSP server and has it's own LSP Client.

You can use this extension and follow the instructions on configuring the LSP server as in: https://github.com/pherrymason/c3-lsp/wiki/Integration-with-editors.

For now, you need to install both extensions to get things done.
